          Pixlr.com was launched in the late summer of 2008 as an online image
          editing tool developed by Ola Sevandersson. Initially offering a
          web-based platform for basic photo editing, it quickly gained
          popularity due to its user-friendly interface and accessible features.
          As Pixlr evolves, it infuses AI into the platform to make userâ€™s
          creative process faster, smarter, and easier. Explore a world where
          your imagination has no limits, and every creative artwork is a
          possibility.
